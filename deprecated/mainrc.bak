# This function is designed to be used inside "mainrc" files.
#  Its function is to get a list of file/dir names and turn them to
#  full paths. Make sure not to print or echo anything else inside it,
#  because unfortunately, to transfer a list of data outside the
#  function, it prints it and then the function caller must take it
#  and turn it into a list again. It's exhausting, I know.
# TODO: change this way of passing data when you've learnt more about it.
